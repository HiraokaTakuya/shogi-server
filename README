= Shogi-server project

The Shogi-server project develops Shogi-server, a rating tool and so on.

== Shogi-server

Shogi-server is a server that implements the Server Protocol Ver 1.1 defined
by Computer Shogi Association (CSA[http://www.computer-shogi.org/index_e.html]) 
in order for computer shogi players to play games.   

=== Pre-requires

Ruby 1.9.3 or 1.8.7

As of January 2012, Shogi-server supports both Ruby 1.9.3 and 1.8.7. In
future, however, it will only work with Ruby 1.9.x.  The Ruby community
claimed that Ruby 1.8 had no future.  It is recommended that you soon
upgrade to Ruby 1.9.3. 

For Debian,
 $ sudo aptitude install ruby1.9.1

Note that the latest ruby1.9.1 package in Debian originates from Ruby 1.9.3.
"1.9.1" in the package name is Ruby internal API version, not release version.

=== Install

 $ git clone git://git.sourceforge.jp/gitroot/shogi-server/shogi-server.git

The following files are required to run Shogi-server:

- shogi-server
- shogi_server.rb
- shogi_server/**/*.rb

=== Run

Examples:

 $ ./shogi-server hoge 4000

 $ ruby1.8 ./shogi-server hoge 4000

 $ ruby1.9.1 ./shogi-server --pid-file shogi-server.pid \
                            --daemon . \
                            --player-log-dir player-log-dir \
                            --floodgate-history floodgate_history.yaml \
                            floodgatetest 4000
