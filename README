The Shogi-server project develops Shogi-server, a rating tool and so on.

== Shogi-server

Shogi-server is a server that implements the Server Protocol Ver 1.1 defined
by Computer Shogi Association (CSA[http://www.computer-shogi.org/index_e.html]) 
in order for computer shogi players to play games.   

=== Pre-requires

Ruby 1.9.3:: Ruby 1.9.2 or earlier are not supported.

The Ruby community claimed that Ruby 1.8 had no future.

As of December 2011, Shogi-server runs with Ruby 1.8.7. In future, however,
incompatible changes may be incorporated in Shogi-server. It is
recommended that you soon upgrade to Ruby 1.9.3.

For Debian,
 $ sudo aptitude install ruby1.9.1

Note that in Debian the latest ruby1.9.1 package comes from Ruby 1.9.3.
"1.9.1" in the package name is Ruby internal API version, not release version.

=== Install

 $ git clone git://git.sourceforge.jp/gitroot/shogi-server/shogi-server.git

The following files are required to run Shogi-server:

- shogi-server
- shogi_server.rb
- shogi_server/**/*.rb

=== Run

 $ ruby1.9.1 ./shogi-server --pid-file shogi-server.pid \
                            --daemon . \
                            --player-log-dir player-log-dir \
                            --floodgate-history floodgate_history.yaml \
                            floodgatetest 4000
