2013-12-13  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - shogi_server/league/floodgate_thread.rb:
	    - Added a log message.

2013-12-08  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - shogi-server/shogi_server/pairing.rb:
	    - Modified comment for LeastDiff match.
	    - Changed log messages and levels. 

2013-12-07  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - shogi_server/pairing.rb, player.rb:
	    Simplify estimated rate of unrated players (less memory).
	  - Enhanced syntax of Floodgate time configuration file.
	    Now it supports "set sacrifice <player_id>"; it sets a
	    sacrificed player for a specific Floodgate game.
	    ex. set sacrifice gps500+e293220e3f8a3e59f79f6b0efffaa931

2013-12-05  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Added a new pairing method, ShogiServer::ExcludeUnratedPlayers,
	    which filters out unrated players.
	  - Enhanced syntax of Floodgate time configuration file.
	    Now it supports "set pairing_factory <function_name>"; it sets a
	    factory function name generating a pairing method which will be
	    used in a specific Floodgate game.
	    ex. set pairing_factory floodgate_zyunisen 

2013-11-24  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - shogi_server/league/floodgate.rb: Improved robustness against
	    empty file under ruby 1.9.3p194
	  - shogi-server:
	    - Previously, reloading in daemon mode failed on
	      ruby 1.9.3p194. This issue has been fixed.
	    - Listen on only IPv4 explicitly. Under ruby 1.9.3p194, without
	      any bind addresses, ruby attempts to listen on both "0.0.0.0"
	      and "::". Specifying "::" on Linux leads to listen on both IPv4
	      and IPv6, which results in a warning message saying "Address
	      already in use - bind(2)".
	* [mk_game_results]
	  - Fixed for reading Japanese comments under ruby1.9.3p194.
	* mk_rate-from-grep, mk_rate-grep:
	  - Removed files that are no longer used.

2013-11-23  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_rate]
	  - gsl library may be provided as a gem
	  - Now duplicated inputs are checked and skipped.
	* test/TC_floodgate.rb
	  - Improved randomness check so that it works on Ruby 2.0.0 as well

2013-11-04  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_rate]
	  - Added a new option, --ignore, which is imported from
	    mk_rate-from-grep.
	* [mk_game_results]
	  - Flush after each output line.
	* Rleased: Revision "20131104"

2013-09-08  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - shogi_server/{game,time_clock}.rb:
	    When StopWatchClock is used, "Time_Unit:" of starting messages
	    in CSA protocol supplies "1min".

2013-04-07  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - shogi_server/{game,time_clock}.rb:
	    Adds variations of thinking time calculation: ChessClock
	    (current) and StopWatchClock (new).
	    StopWatchClock, which is usually used at official games of human
	    professional players, is a clock where thiking time less than a
	    miniute is regarded as zero.
	    To select StopWatchClock, use a special game name with "060"
	    byoyomi time. ex. "gamename_1500_060".

2013-03-31  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - %%FORK command: %%FORK <source_game> [<new_buoy_game>] [<nth-move>]
	    The new_buoy_game parameter is now optional. If it is not
	    supplied, Shogi-server generates a new buoy game name from
	    source_game.
	  - command.rb: More elaborate error messages for the %%GAME command.

2013-03-20  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - New pairing algorithm: ShogiServer::Pairing::LeastDiff
	    This pairing algorithm aims to minimize the total differences of
	    matching players' rates. It also includes penalyties when a match
	    is same as the previous one or a match is between human players.
	    It is based on a discussion with Yamashita-san on
	    http://www.sgtpepper.net/kaneko/diary/20120511.html.

2013-02-23  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - New command: %%FORK <source_game> <new_buoy_game> [<nth-move>]
	    Fork a new game from the posistion where the n-th (starting from
	    one) move of a source game is played. The new game should be a
	    valid buoy game name. The default value of n is the position
	    where the previous position of the last one.
	    - The objective of this command: The shogi-server may be used as
	    the back end server of computer-human match where a human player
	    plays with a real board and someone, or a proxy, inputs moves to
	    the shogi-server. If the proxy happens to enter a wrong move,
	    with this command you can restart a new buoy game from the
	    previous stable position.
	    ex. %%FORK server-denou-14400-60+p1+p2+20130223185013 buoy_denou-14400-60

2011-12-18  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - shogi_server/board.rb, piece.rb: Refactoring to cache OU pieces,
	    which was inspired by 81SquareShogi-server's change
	    (74b24b88c843f1dd767412475b117481d1d5e8eb).
	  - Added shogi-server-profile to take profile of shogi-server.

2010-10-06  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - mk_rate: the usage was not updated.
	    Thanks to Hoki-san to report this issue.  (Closes: #23358)

2010-09-18  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - shogi_server/board.rb, game.rb: For hadicapped games, wrong
	    initial positions were delivered to players and monitors.  This
	    issue has been fixed. (Closes: #23245) 
	    Thanks to HIDETCHI for reporting the issue.

2010-09-05  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - shogi_server/login.rb: Enhanced the CSA Login mode.
	    Logging in the server with the CSA mode, users are now allowed to
	    specify a turn preference in an enhanced gamename string which
	    looks like <gamename>-<time>-<time>-<turn>. The first three 
	    parts are a regular game definition. The last "-<turn>"
	    part is optional. 
	    + Without -<turn> (i.e. same as the previous behavior), there
	    is no turn preference. A user's turn will be defined randomly. 
	    + <turn> is either "B" for black or "W" for white.

2010-09-04  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - shogi_server/{board,command,game,league,player}.rb
	    The Buoy behavior is changed.
	    + Starting a buoy game, players are notified a starting game
	      position with the initial position and moves, instead of a
	      targeting position.
	    + Players are allowed to start buoy games with specific turns.
	      ex. %%GAME buoy_foo-1500-0 +

2010-08-05  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - shogi_server/command.rb: Prevent a possible password from be
	    logged in a log file when players send invalid LOGIN-like commands.
	    Thanks to Tomoyuki Kaneko for this idea.

2010-08-03  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - sample/{check_file.rb,check_time.rb,check_time2.rb,test_time.rb}:
	    Added new files to test an issue where mtime of log files was
	    earlier than system time.
	  - shogi_server/league/floodgate_thread.rb: SetupFloodgate#start
	    now returns an instance correctly.
	  - ../shogi_server.rb, ../shogi_server/util.rb: Refactored
	    mkdir_for to Mkdir.mkdir_for.
	  - ../shogi_server/game.rb: mkdir_p will be performed in a global
	    mutex of ShogiServer::Mkdir.

2010-07-25  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - shogi_server/command.rb: 
	    + For an unknown error command log, an empty line is no longer logged.
	    + Commands specific to 81Dojo, starting with '%%%', are just
	      ignored instead of unknown command errors.
	  - shogi_server.rb: 
	    + Refactoring. Added test/TC_logger.rb to test
	      ShogiServer::Logger class.
	    + Fixed race condition: creating a new directory to archive
	      logs may have caused race condition, which ended up with
	      making the server unavailable. This issue has been fixed. 
	  - shogi-server:
	    + Improved fault tolerance of the server.

2010-07-23  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - shogi_server/league/floodgate_thread.rb: When the server run
	    with DEBUG mode, it ended up with an undefined variable error. 
	    This issue has been fixed.

2010-07-17  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - shogi_server.rb, shogi_server/board.rb, shogi_server/move.rb
	    - Refactoring: Board can now move_to() and move_back() a move
	      instead of deep_copy().

2010-07-11  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - shogi_server/player.rb: Set initial values to BasicPlayer's
	    instance variables.
	  - shogi_server/league.rb: Improved performance of
	    Persistant#get_players. It took about 20 seconds for a large
	    size of players (5,300 lines in players.yaml). Now it completes in an
	    instance.

2010-06-22  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - A new command line option: 
	      --floodgate-names GameStringA[,GameStringB[,...]]
	    where a game string should be a valid game name such as
	    floodgate-900-0.  
	    .
	    Note: Without this option, no floodgate games are started. If
	    you want floodgate-900-0 to run, which was default enabled in
	    previous versions, you need to specify the game name in this new
	    option.
	  - Floodgate time configuration file:
	    You need to set starting times of floodgate groups in
	    configuration files under the top directory. Each floodgate
	    group requires a corresponding configuration file named
	    "<game_name>.conf". The file will be re-read once just after a
	    game starts. 
	    .
	    For example, a floodgate-3600-30 game group requires
	    floodgate-3600-30.conf.  However, for floodgate-900-0 and
	    floodgate-3600-0, which were default enabled in previous
	    versions, configuration files are optional if you are happy with
	    default time settings.
	    File format is:
	      Line format: 
	        # This is a comment line
	        DoW Time
	        ...
	      where
	        DoW := "Sun" | "Mon" | "Tue" | "Wed" | "Thu" | "Fri" | "Sat" |
	               "Sunday" | "Monday" | "Tuesday" | "Wednesday" | "Thursday" |
	               "Friday" | "Saturday" 
	        Time := HH:MM
	     
	      For example,
	        Sat 13:00
	        Sat 22:00
	        Sun 13:00

2010-06-01  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - shogi_server/command.rb: Fixed an issue that MONITOR2OFF did not
	    work. Thanks to HIDECHI and koudayu.

2010-05-10  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - test/*.rb: Improved performance and stability of tests
	  - shogi_server/player.rb: Help the write_thread to terminate

2010-05-06  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_rate]
	  - Previously mk_rate did not count in draw games. Now a draw game
	    is considered to weight 0.5 win and 0.5 loss. Respect
	    Inaniwa-shogi which strategically aims to draw.
	  - a new command line option, --skip-draw-games. In this mode, draw
	    games are just ignored as mk_rate previously did.

2010-04-25  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - shogi_server/player.rb:
	    Log a warning message in a case that a player closes a
	    connection suddenly.

2010-04-13  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - shogi_server/command.rb:
	    Equality of MonitorHandler class was wrong. %%MONITOROFF and
	    %%MONITOR2OFF may cause unexpected behavior. This issue has been
	    fixed. Thanks to Kota Fujiwara for reporting.

2010-03-07  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - If two sequential moves from a player are identical, the last
	    one will be ignored and a game is in play. This situation might
	    happen with human players, especially on slow network,
	    impatiently sending a move twice. 

2010-02-27  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - The server now provides more accurate time control. Previously,
	    a player's thinking time included a time waiting to get the giant
	    lock. This may have caused games to time up, especially, during
	    byo-yomi etc.

2010-01-22  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Experimental feature: support handicapped games.
	    Game names that have the following prefixes are recognized as
	    handicapped games. Turn symbols "+" and "-" mean Uwate (expert)
	    and Shitate (beginner) respectively (i.e. Uwate players first).
	    "*" is not available. 
	    - hclance_
	    - hcbishop_
	    - hcrook_
	    - hcrooklance_
	    - hc2p_
	    - hc4p_
	    - hc6p_
	    - hc10p_

2010-01-16  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - shogi_server/command.rb, test/TC_command.rb
	    Proposal implementation of a new command called MONITOR2{ON,OFF}.
	    When the MONITOR2ON command is issued by a player, the server
	    immediately sends the player the entire contents of a record
	    file of the game, i.e. history of moves and so on, at that time.
	    Then, the server will forward subsequent moves like they are
	    appended to the record file.
	  - Behavior changed: A player monitoring a game with MONITORON will
	    not receive Game#show again when a gaming player resigns (:toryo).

2010-01-10  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* Converted the repository from Subversion to Git.

2009-12-26 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org> 

	* [shogi-server]
	  - The server can now provide multiple floodgate modes such as
	    floodgate-900-0 and floodgate-3600-0.

2009-12-25 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - shogi-server: The command line option --floodgate-history has
	    been deprecated. The server will decide history file names such
	    as 'floodgate_history_900_0.yaml' and
	    'floodgate_history_3600_0.yaml', and then put them in the top
	    directory.

2009-12-20 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - shogi_server/player.rb: Added new methods: is_human? and
	    is_computer?. 
	    A human player is recommended to use a name ending with '_human'.  
	    ex. 'hoge_human', 'hoge_human@p1'
	  - shogi_server/pairing.rb: Added a new class:
	    StartGameWithoutHumans, which tries to make pairs trying to
	    avoid a human-human match. This is now enabled instead of the
	    previous class: StartGame.
	  - shogi-server, shogi_server/league/floodgate.rb:
	    Changed the argument of Floodgate.new.

2009-12-04 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - The HUP signal is not supported by Ruby on Windows.

2009-11-11 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_rate]
	  - Added a new command line option: --base-date. You can specify a
	    base date to calculate rating scores. Games in the `future' are
	    ignored for the calculation.

2009-11-10 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - The server logs a result of each game to a file named '00LIST',
	    which will be used to generate players.yaml. If the file does
	    not exist, the server will create one automatically.
	    Instruction to use the game result list file:
	    1. Make a list of game results from existing CSA files with
	       mk_game_results
	       % ./mk_game_results dir_of_csa_files > 00LIST
	    2. Run the server. It appends a result of each game to
	       '00LIST' when the game finishes.
	    3. From the list of game results, calculate rating scores of
	       players.
	       % ./mk_rate 00LIST > players.yaml

2009-11-08 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_rate]
	  - Split a pre-process collecting game results from csa files into
	    a new command, mk_game_results. Now, Generating players.yaml
	    requires two steps as follows:
	      % ./mk_game_results dir_of_csa_files > 00LIST
	      % ./mk_rate 00LIST > players.yaml
	      or
	      % ./mk_game_results dir_of_csa_files | ./mk_rate > players.yaml 
	    (Closes: #19454)

2009-08-06 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - A experimental new feature, codenamed Buoy: it allows players to
	    play a game starting with a specified position. First, a player
	    sets a buoy game with moves to a specific position. Then, two
	    players can play a new game with the game name.
	    New commands:
	    + %%SETBUOY <game_name> <moves> [count]
	      Set a new buoy game.
	      ex. %%SETBUOY buoy_foo-900-0 +7776FU 10
	      ex. %%SETBUOY buoy_foo-1500-0 +7776FU-3334FU
	      - game_name is a valid game name with a prefix "buoy_".
	      ex. buoy_foo-900-0
	      - moves are initial moves from the Hirate position to a
	      specific position that you want to start with.
	      ex. +7776FU-3334FU+8786FU
	      - count is an optional attribute to tell how many times the
	      game can be played (default 1). The count is decremented
	      when the game finishes. If the count reaches zero, the buoy
	      game is removed automatically by the server.
	      ex. 10
	    + %%DELETEBUOY <game_name>
	      Delete a buoy game. The only owner who set up the game is
	      allowed to delete it.
	      ex. %%DELETEBUOY buoy_foo-900-0
	      - game_name is the buoy game name that was created.
	    + %%GETBUOYCOUNT <game_name>
	      Show a current count of the buoy game or -1 for non-existing
	      games.


2009-07-11 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - shogi_server/command.rb: refactored commands out of player.rb.

2009-06-18 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - An empty floodgate_history.yaml caused a server error. This
	    issue has been fixed. 
	    (Closes: #15124)

2009-06-17 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - If a new game matched between two players is not started within
	    a certain time (default 120 seconds) (i.e. the agree_waiting or
	    start_waiting state lasts too long), the Server REJECTs the game.
	    (Closes: #14425)

2009-06-15 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - When a Gote player AGREEd a new game and then a Sente player
	    logged out (LOGOUT), the Gote incorrectly received a LOGOUT message 
	    from the server. Since Gote's state was not AGREEd or STARTed yet,
	    the Gote should be REJECTed. This issue has been fixed. 
	    (Closes: #17335)

2009-06-14 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - The Board could not recognize a certain pattern of
	    Oute-Sennichite. This issue has been fixed.
	    (Closes: #13966)

2009-03-22 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [utils/correct-bug14635.rb]
	  - Added a new file. This program corrects illegal lines introduced
	    by the #14635 bug.

2009-03-07 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [csa-file-filter]
	  - Improved performance.

2009-02-15 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - A duplicated comment that is the one of the previous (or older)
	    move might be erroneously recorded in a csa file. This issue has 
	    been fixed. (Closes: #15080)

2009-02-11 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [utils/csa-filter.rb]
	  - Added a new file. This program filters CSA files.

2009-02-01 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - The shogi-server records csa files of games in an illegal
	    format. This issue has been fixed. (Closes: #14635)
	  - A ##[MONITOR] command for showing a game result such as %TORYO
	    was not correct. This issue has been fixed.  

2009-01-13 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - It failed to proccess a game result, OuteKaihiMoreWin where a
	    checked king does not escape. This issue has been fixed.

2009-01-02 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - shogi_server/timeout_queue.rb: the timeout parameter of the
	    constructor was not respected erroneously. This issue
	    has been fixed.
	  - shogi_server/players.rb: When a player was finishing with its
	    write socket broken, there was a chance that the thread of the
	    player in the giant lock had to wait for a long time (about 20
	    seconds), which might cause threads of other players stop and 
	    time out. (Closes: #14469)

2008-12-30 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_html]
	  - Added a new option: --footer filename, which inserts contents of 
	    the filename at the bottom of a generated page. A text specific to 
	    wdoor should be written by using this option. 
	    (Closes: #14470)
	  - It does no more depend on RDoc. RDoc::usage does not work well
	    (due to RDoc).

2008-12-28 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_rate]
	  - Check kifu files more carefully so that files that contain
	    incomplete records are skipped.
	  - mk_rate might have failed to alloc due to out of memory. Now it
	    consumes less memory (about 200MB instead of 2GB).
	  - File names can be put into STDIN instead of specifying directory
	    names in command line arguments.
	* [csa-file-filter]
	  - New file. It filters kifu files and is of use for a pre-filter
	    of mk_rate.

2008-12-13 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Improved an existance check and etc. of directories specified
	    by command line options, especially in case of the daemon mode. 
	    (Closes: #14244)
	  - A rotated log file is moved to $topdir/YYYY/MM/DD.
	    (Closes: #14245)

2008-11-27 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Added sample/*.sh for command line samples.

2008-11-24 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Added a new option --floodgate-history, which allows users to
	    specify a file name that stores the records of games. The
	    records are taken care of when games are matched.

2008-10-18 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [utils/eval_graph.rb]
	  - Display time control graphs as well.
	    Thanks to Nishimura-san for this idea.
	    (Closes: #13678)

2008-10-08 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Ruby 1.8.7 (or later) must be used. Ruby 1.8.6 is not supported.
	  - Daemon mode is available.
	  - shogi_server/piece_ky.rb is again merged with
	    shogi_server/piece.rb, then has been removed.  
	  - Added a test case, TC_usi.rb.

2008-06-30 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Added a new option --player-log-dir, which allows users to log
	    messages that are received or sent to the wire.

2008-06-28 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - A rating comment line is now written before the first move in a
	    record file instead of after the last move, which allows other
	    applications watching a game to recognize players in the middle 
	    of the game. (Closes #12821)
	  - If a player, including a monitor, stuck at the time of sending
	    messages to the wire, which means that the giant lock was locked,
	    it might have prevented other players from processing until
	    timeout occurred. This issue has been fixed. (Closes #12555)

2008-06-27 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  -  Pairing players might not have shuffled players because of
	     poor shuffling algorithm. This issue has been fixed.
	     (Closes: #12661)

2008-06-25 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [players_graph.rb]
	  - Check invalid arguments. (Closes: #12856)

2008-06-23 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_rate]
	  - Added a new option: --fixed-rate and --fixed-rate-player
	    whose rate always results in that rate. (Closes: #12800)

2008-06-06 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - The source has been splited to multiple sub files.
	  - The program now depends on rubygems and activesupport.
	  - The program can reload the source files on the flight, by
	    sending a HUP signal to the server.
	  - The server log will be rotated daily.

2008-05-18 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Last game results (win or lose) of x1 players were not
	    available on the next game. This issue has been fixed.
	    Thanks to Tomoyuki Kaneko for debugging.
	  - For draw games, "'rating" line in a .csa file was 
	    wrong (meaningless). This issue has been fixed.

2008-05-16 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [news]
	  - The repository has been converted from CVS to Subversion.

2008-05-13 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Floodgate's thread could cause an error when players.yaml was
	    cleared by another program (mk_rate). This issue has been 
	    fixed.
	  - Give default values to BasicPlayer, which fixed undefined 
	    method error in Pairing.

2008-05-10 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - The server could not recognize uchifuzume as an illegal move.
	    This bug has been fixed.
	  - The server crashed by an undefined method error.
	    This issue has been fixed.

2008-05-05 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - .csa files will be located in a sub directory such as
	    "2008/05/05/*.csa". These days, we have many games in a day. 
	    This change will help users browse a file list.

2008-05-03 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_html]
	  - Show players who have accessed in the last 30 minutes with 
	    different colors.

2008-04-22 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_html]
	  - When YSS was not rated on the wdoor mode, wrong rate24 scores
	    were displayed. This issue has been fixed. Now YSS absence 
	    results in "N/A".

2008-04-21 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_rate]
	  - The half-life period is now configurable.
	    ex $ ./mk_rate --half-life 14 --half-life-ignore 7 <records>

2008-04-12 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Renamed variables (@id) since they caused Ruby's warning.

2008-04-11 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Improved a way to handle diferred moves (2008-03-24's change),
	    based on Tomoyuki Kaneko's patch.

2008-04-01 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - An incorrect LOGIN crashed the server. This issue has been
	    fixed.

2008-03-24 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Converting characters for comments in moves caused an error. This 
	    issue has been fixed.
	  - If a player moves in the opponent's turn, it is illegal. But the
	    current CSA protocol does not clearly define a way to tell so to 
	    the players. This shogi-server internally keeps such a move in a
	    buffer and replay it when the player of the move gets his/her 
	    turn.

2008-03-16 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Erroneously, Board#to_s's current player was always Black.
	    It caused wrong determination of sennichite since it did not
	    care about the current player of a state. This has been fixed.
	    Thanks Takada-san for reporting this bug.

2008-03-10 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [util/players-graph.rb]
	  - Applied Kaneko-san's patch, which also shows expected-rate24
	    rates.
	  - Small PNG gets smaller.

2008-03-08 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_html]
	- Added an option --wdoor. In this mode, a rate expected at Shogi
	  Club 24 is calculated from YSS's rating (he is 2400 now). 

2008-03-04 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_rate]
	  - If the computed ratings do not stabilize, then mk_rate aborts.
	      $ ./mk_rate dir && ./mk_rate dir > players.yaml 
	    can avoid rewriting the invalid ratings to the file.

2008-02-23 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - A comment is converted to EUC-JP and then written in a log.
	    Note that this conversion guesses the input encoding. Clients
	    are recommended to send EUC-JP compatible strings to the
	    server.

2008-02-21 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [util/players-graph.rb]
	  - Released. Draw a chart for a player's rating score.

2008-02-17 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - An illegal teban specified for Floodgate login could crash the
	    server. This issue has been fixed.

2008-02-16 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Thread.abort_on_exception is now false, meaning that 
	    a thread's abort does not affect the others. 
	  - The uchifuzume check did not generate promoting moves, which
	    could crash the server with illegal moves. This issue has
	    been fixed.

2008-02-14 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Added a new pairing variation, Swiss-like style. Winners at the
	    previous games (his/her point of view, not the server's) are 
	    paired first, and then the others are matched. This is the 
	    default option now.
	  - Pairing classes are located in a separate source file,
	    pairing.rb. The file is 'load'ed each time to be used,
	    meaning that modifying the code will be applied to a running
	    server.
	  - You can specify a single player who will be out of pairing
	    when there are odd players waiting for Floodgate.

2008-02-13 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - When there are odd players wating for Floodgate, the random
	    pairing deletes the player who has ever played the most games.

2008-02-08 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [ml_html]
	  - For the Not-Yet-Rated group, those who have not connected
	    recently are not listed.
	* [shogi-server]
	  - Floodgate's thread checks the current time each 10 secs.

2008-02-05 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_rate] [mk_html]
	  - Display not-yet-rated players as well.
	* [mk_html]
	  - Use Yahoo! UI Library.

2008-02-04 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server] [webserver]
	  - In the daemon mode, if the specified directory was a relative
	    path, the server could fail to start with a permission denied
	    error. This issue has been fixed. The path is interpreted as 
	    an absolute path before switching to daemon. 
	  - In the daemon mode, a wrong process id was written in 
	    '--pid-file'. This issue has been fixed. Also, the pid file
	    will be removed when the server shuts down.

2008-02-03 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Game names that are recognized as the floodgate mode are now 
	    /^floodgate-\d+-\d+$/.
	  - Floodgate could not schedule the next time when it was the next
	    day. This issue has been fixed.

2008-02-02 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Implemented a new feature, Floodgate mode, for covenience with
	    public rating games. Now there is a special game "wdoor-900-0".
	    Matching players for that game is scheduled each 30 minitues.

2007-11-03 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_rate]
	 - Support Ruby 1.8.6 patch level 111 (or higher) and GSL 1.10 (or higher).
	   It may not work with lower verions. 

2007-09-06 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - The logic to detect Oute-Sennichite was not complete. Both players
	    (checking side and escaping side) may cause Oute-Sennichite. The old
	    logic only cared for the checking player. This issue has been fixed.

2007-06-16  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [webserver]
	  - Initial version. This web server is an interface between HTTP and
	    shogi-server. Shogi-server commands will be available over HTTP. As
	    of now %%LIST and %%WHO commands are supported.
	* [mk_rate]
	  - Bumped up GAME_LIMIT (from 10) to 15 because the calculation of
	    rates sometimes went wrong (infinite values).

2007-04-21  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Implemented `CHALLENGE' command, and the server will respond with
	    `CHALLENGE ACCEPTED'. Note that this command is dummy for this server
	    because it is only available for CSA's official testing server and does
	    not belong to the CSA standard protocol.  Therefor, when clients receive
	    `CHALLENGE ACCEPTED' from this server, they must ignore it.
	  - Show revision in a start up message.

2007-04-01  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Implemented one of the keepalive protocol in CSA protocol; If clients
	    send LF, the server sends back LF.
	  - More care for socket errors.

2007-03-27  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_rate] When there were too few games to rate players (i.e. no
	  player to rate), mk_rate caused an error. Now it no longer shows
	  the error.

2007-03-10  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_html] Popup shows additional information.

2007-03-02  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Use WEBrick for server framework.
	  - Daemon mode is available.

2007-02-26  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Failed to show usage. This issue has been fixed. 
	  - Initial start of the server failed beacause of empty players.yaml.
	    This issues has been fixed.

2007-02-18  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_html]
	  - Show groups in the order specified in players.html.
	  - Players who gamed recently have a background color.
	* [mk_rate]
	  - Implemented half-life effect. Numbers of win/lose decrease by this effect.

2006-11-26  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server] Sente (gote) was able to move gote's (sente's) hand.
	  That move should be illegal. This issue has been fixed.

2006-11-01  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_rate] Skip "abnormal" games, which were finished because of
	  network failure or communication error.  Recently some programs seem
	  to have a lot of tries to connect to the Shogi Server at wdoor for
	  debugging. We should ignore such games for a while to get a meaningful
	  ratings.

2006-10-30  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_rate][mk_html]
	  - Put players into "connected" groups in order to
	    show a correct, meaningful rating. In the group, each player has at
	    least a game with other players.
	  - The format of players.yaml was updated.
	* [shogi-server] Followed the new format of players.yaml.

2006-10-08  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_rate] Corrected making win_loss_matrix.

2006-10-02  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_rate] players who never win or lose are not rated in order
	  the calculation to complete.

2006-09-30  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server] The CSA mode supports the trip in a password.

2006-09-22  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server] Refactored the login procedures.

2006-09-21  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_rate] It failed parse draw games. Now this bug has been fixed.
	* [mk_html] Add CSS to look better.

2006-09-15  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Remove the trip in a password. Now the password is hashed.
	* [mk_rate]
	  - Support @NORATE syntax in a name, which avoids the player is
	    rated.

2006-09-09  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Support a new command, %%VERSION. It shows the server's revision#.

2006-09-07  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Re-design: trip is now a suffix of the password, not name.
	  - Simplified the output of %%RATING.
	* [mk_rate]
	  - Support "@" indentificaton in a name; players with same
	    before-@-names are mapped to one.

2006-09-05  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_rate] Fix a bug. It solves the correct rate.

2006-08-18  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_rate] Re-design. 
	  - Correct the equations.
	  - Apply deaccelerated Newton method.

2006-08-16  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_rate]
	  - Fix a bug. Now it can see black/white players in a csa file.
	* [shogi-server]
	  - Add a space in the output of %%RATING.

2006-08-14  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_rate] Record numbers of win/loss games.
	* Add mk_html, which generates html from players.yaml
	* Fix test/test_board.rb. Now it works. 
	* Add test/TC_ALL.rb to run all test cases.
	* [shogi-server] Fix a bug. Now it can show %%RATING even if it has no
	  rated player.

2006-08-11  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>
	
	* Add mk_rate, which calculate rating scores.
